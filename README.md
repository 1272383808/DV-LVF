<h1>Detecting Vulnerabilities via Explicitly Leveraging Vulnerability Features on Program Slices</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The paper presents a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities in software systems and proposes a method that explicitly leverages vulnerability features on program slices to detect vulnerabilities more effectively. By focusing on specific features within program slices, the proposed approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of vulnerability detection.
